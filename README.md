# DiaVest

The mobile application code for a non-invasive diabetes management system that utilized patient's electrocardiogram signals to predict blood glucose levels, heart attacks, and heart arrhythmia using machine learning models and a wearable vest. The vest connects to the mobile app via a bluetooth chip and the app uploads data to a Flask API for processing. This repository simply contains the user interface where users can track glucose levels and heart-related events.
